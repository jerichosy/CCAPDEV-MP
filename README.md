## Local Set Up
- MongoDB must be installed and running before starting.
- Download the ZIP file of the repository and unzip it in your location of choice. Alternatively, `git clone` the repo.
- Open a command prompt in the location of the unzipped folder (e.g., using `cd <path>`, or by right-clicking then "Open in Windows Terminal", etc.).
- Run `npm install` in the command prompt to install the necessary dependencies.
- Then to run the application just execute the command `node index.js`. Alternatively, do `npm run dev` to auto-restart node when file changes are detected (be sure to do `npm install nodemon -g` first).
- To access the web application simply open in your web browser the url `http://localhost:3000/`
